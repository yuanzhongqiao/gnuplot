Gnuplot 确实是一个非常强大且灵活的命令行驱动的交互式函数绘图工具。它可以在多种操作系统上运行，包括 Linux、OSX、MS Windows、VMS 等，使得用户可以在不同的平台上进行绘图操作。虽然 Gnuplot 是受版权保护的，但它是免费分发的，这意味着用户无需支付任何费用即可使用。

Gnuplot 的设计初衷是为了帮助科学家和学生更好地可视化数学函数和数据。通过 Gnuplot，用户可以轻松地绘制出各种复杂的数学图形，从而更好地理解和分析数据。此外，Gnuplot 还支持多种类型的输出设备，如终端、打印机等，并且可以将图形保存为多种文件格式，这为用户提供了极大的便利。

除了基本功能外，Gnuplot 还具有很强的扩展性。用户可以轻松地添加新的设备支持，这使得 Gnuplot 能够适应更多的应用场景。同时，由于其开源的特性，用户还可以根据需要对软件进行定制和优化，以满足特定的绘图需求。

总的来说，Gnuplot 是一个功能强大、灵活易用的绘图工具，非常适合科学家、学生和其他需要进行数据可视化的人群使用。




The Gnuplot Plotting Utility
============================

 Gnuplot is a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility
for linux, OSX, MSWin, VMS, and many other platforms.  The software is
copyrighted but freely distributed (i.e., you don't have to pay for it).
It was originally written to allow scientists and students to visualize
mathematical functions and data.  Gnuplot supports output to many types
of terminals, printers, and file formats.  It is easily extensible to
include new devices.  

 The "gnu" in gnuplot is NOT related to the Free Software Foundation.
The naming is just a coincidence (and a long story; see the gnuplot FAQ
for details). Thus gnuplot is not covered by the GPL (GNU Public License)
copyleft, but rather by its own copyright statement, included in all source
code files.  Some code modules are dual-licensed.

 Gnuplot handles both curves (2 dimensions) and surfaces (3 dimensions).
Surfaces can be plotted as a mesh fitting the specified function, floating
in the 3-d coordinate space, or as a contour plot on the x-y plane.
For 2-d plots, there are also many plot styles including lines, points,
boxes, heat maps, stacked histograms, and contoured projections of 3D data.
Graphs may be labeled with arbitrary labels and arrows, axis labels, 
a title, date and time, and a key.  The interface includes command-line
editing and history on most platforms.

 The new gnuplot user should begin by reading the general information
available by typing `help` after running gnuplot. Then read about the
`plot` command (type `help plot`).  The manual for gnuplot (which is a
nicely formatted version of the on-line help information) is available
as a PDF document, created via LaTeX.  Look at the docs/Makefile
for other options for formatting the documentation.

 The gnuplot source code and executables may be copied and/or modified
freely as long as the copyright messages are left intact.

Copyright and Porting
=====================

 See the Copyright file for copyright conditions.

 See the ChangeLog and docs/old/History.old file for changes to gnuplot.

 Build instructions are in the INSTALL file.  Some additional
information needed to port gnuplot to new platforms not covered by
GNU autoconf can be found in the PORTING file. 

 The code for gnuplot was written with portability in mind, and has been
run on an amazing variety of operating systems and hardware over the years.
However, the current code has not been tested on all those older platforms
and some of the conditional code to support quirks of obsolete compilers
and OS features has been removed.  You can expect that gnuplot will compile
more or less out of the box on any system that has a c99 compliant C compiler.
Some optional drivers are written in C++ or lua.

Help and Bug Reports
====================

 Your primary place to go searching for help with gnuplot should
be the project's webpage.  At the time of this writing, that's

	http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net

 It has links to a lot of material, including the project's development
page, also at SourceForge:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/

 There are separate tracking systems for Feature Requests and proposed
patches that implement new features, also hosted at SourceForge.

 All bug reports should include the version of gnuplot you are using,
the operating system and version you are running it on, and the output
device (gnuplot's "terminal") that you are plotting to.  It helps a lot
to provide a simple script, possibly with data, that reproducibly 
demonstrates the problem you are reporting.
 
Mailing Lists
=============

 The gnuplot mailing lists are currently operated through the general
development site on SourceForge.net.  Subscribe to mailing lists via
the web interface at
	
	http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=2055

 The lists you may be interested in are "gnuplot-info" and "gnuplot-beta".
"gnuplot-info" is for general discussion and questions about how to use
the program.  "gnuplot-beta" is for discussion about possible new features,
plans for future work, release schedules, or other development issues.
